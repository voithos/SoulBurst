# TODOs

- obstacle assets
- obstacle collision logic
- death / explosion animation
- boost assets
- boost logic + gradual slow-down logic

Approach A:
  - logic for "escape level" threshold
  - animation for "escape level"
  - level reset logic
  - logic for increasing difficulty over time?

Approach B:
  - logic for "distance traveled" before dying

## Polish

- music
- sound effects
- fps not great
- camera follows too far back when going fast

## Done
- improved roll/pitch animation
- environment assets
- logic for environment asset movement / loading / unloading
- tweak lighting + post-process
- spacecraft assets
- camera lag not working
- camera follow stutters when there's a frame dip
- score

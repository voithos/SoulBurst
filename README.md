[Escape the lost city](https://voithos.itch.io/soulburst).

SoulBurst is an "infinite flyer" prototype built solo in Unreal Engine. Fly
through a cyber city at high speeds, burst through boosters to gain bonus
points, and achieve the highest score that you can. But in the end, the city
lets none escape...

## Controls

- Movement - W/A/S/D or gamepad analog stick
- Restart level - R or gamepad right trigger/shoulder
- Fly through booster gates to gain speed
- Esc to exit

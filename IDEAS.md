# Ideas

Theme: Running out of space

## Brainstorm

1. Superhot, except room shrinks every time you take a step
  - First-person?
  - Variation of this that involves parkour?
2. Infinite runner where world is crumbling behind you
  - Top down, or side scrolling
3. Survival game where room slowly gets filled with enemies, survive for as long as you can
5. Survival racing game, where world is crumbling behind you
  - Sci-fi Burnout where you want to smash opponents, but also outrun the explodey road thing
6. Atmospheric game where you're exploring some space (an island? a laboratory? etc) and rooms / land keeps disappearing
7. Hectic game where the floor is crumbling and you have to move your furniture, etc, to avoid having it fall to the abyss
  - THIS COULD BE BASED ON MY HOUSE :|
8. Third person action earthbending game where you run out of level space
9. Action game where the ground is collapsing

## Chosen

Story of trying to escape to space
- Some sort of space craft game, where you collect items or move through checkpoints
- You speed up as you do so
- Goal is to speed up enough to warp to space
